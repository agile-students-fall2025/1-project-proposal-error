# CampusConnect 

## What and Why?  
Campus life comes with a lot of different pieces such as events, deadlines, dining options, club meetings, and academic resources. Most universities like NYU share this information across multiple apps, websites, and bulletins, making it overwhelming and diffcult for students to keep track of everything.  

**CampusConnect** is a mobile web application that centralizes all important campus resources for each student. Instead of using multiple systems, students will have one centralized hub where they can:  
- See upcoming events and deadlines
- Browse and connect with student organizations  
- Set reminders for class assignments or university deadlines  

The problem it solves is information overload and fragmentation. By unifying and simplifying student life into one app, we reduce missed opportunities, wasted time, and unnecessary frustration.  

## For Whom?  
The target audience is NYU students. Over time, the platform could be adapted for other universities.  

## How?  
From the end-user’s perspective, CampusConnect will:  

- **Dashboard:** Display personalized schedules, like class reminders, assignment deadlines, and campus events, all in one place  
- **Events & Clubs:** Allow students to browse upcoming events, RSVP, and follow clubs they’re interested in   
- **Reminders & Notifications:** Send gentle reminders for events, deadlines, or personal tasks  
- **Discovery:** Suggest events, resources, or groups based on a student’s interests and past activity  

## Scope  
 
We can implement core features such as the dashboard, event integration, and dining menus using university resources. The system requires user accounts, data management, notifications, and a clean frontend, which provide plenty of technical depth. If needed, features like AI-based event recommendations can be included.
